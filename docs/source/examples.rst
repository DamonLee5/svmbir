The package contains two example bash scripts in the ``svmbir/demo`` folder to serve as templates for new users.
The first script, demo_simple.py_ demonstrates how to perform a basic MBIR reconstruction.
The second script, demo_complex.py_ contains a more complex demo that:

.. _demo_simple.py: ipynb/demo_simple.html
.. _demo_complex.py: ipynb/demo_complex.html

*  Performs a basic MBIR reconstruction;
*  Computes a forward projection of the reconstructed image;
*  Displays an error sinogram;
*  Exercises the proximal-map reconstruction feature.

These examples linked above show how these scripts should typically run in your environment.
