The package contains two example bash scripts in the ``svmbir/demo`` folder which can serve as templates for new users. The first script, ``demo_simple.py`` demonstrates how to perform a basic MBIR reconstruction. The second script, ``demo_complex.py`` contains a more complex demo that:

*	Performs a basic MBIR reconstruction;
*  Computes a forward projection of the reconstructed image;
*  Displays an error sinogram;
*  Exercises the proximal-map reconstruction feature.

The examples below show how these scripts should typically run in your environment.
